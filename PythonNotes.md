# Array Problems in Python:
  - There is not `.contains()` or `.has()` method like in JS so we do a loop in the object.
  - `if num in nums`
  - Dont use the `.update()` method. This merges the dict and not add a new value
  - Get the length of an item we can use `range()` method and the `len()` method
  - In Python, dictionaries are unordered collections (before Python 3.7, they didn't maintain insertion order). The == operator only checks:
      - If the keys are the same
      - If the values for each key match
      - The order of key-value pairs does not matter.
  - If you want to do a for loop in order to get the index
      - `for i in range(len())`
  - If you want to do `.push()` method in python you need to use `.append()`
